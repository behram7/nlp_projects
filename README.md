# üõ°Ô∏è Hate Speech Detection Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect hate speech in text data. It involves preprocessing text, transforming it using TF-IDF vectorization, and applying classification models such as Logistic Regression to accurately distinguish between hateful and non-hateful content. The solution is designed for scalability and can be extended for use in content moderation, social media monitoring, or any platform that aims to promote respectful online communication.
