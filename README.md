# 🛡️ Hate Speech Detection Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in textual content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to automatically identify and classify text that contains hate speech, offensive language, or harmful intent, helping platforms maintain safer and more inclusive digital spaces.

## 📖 Project Description

In an era of increasing online communication, hate speech has become a major concern on social media platforms, forums, and public comment sections. This project aims to build a robust and interpretable machine learning model capable of flagging hateful content in text, thereby assisting in content moderation and filtering.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:  
  Removes noise such as punctuation, stopwords, and special characters while performing tokenization and lemmatization to normalize the text data.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**:  
  Converts textual content into numerical vectors to be used in machine learning models, preserving term importance and frequency.

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  Logistic Regression is used as a baseline classifier due to its simplicity and efficiency. The approach can be extended to include Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models like LSTM and BERT.

- **Performance Evaluation**:  
  Utilizes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess model effectiveness.

- **Explainability**:  
  Focused on interpretable models to ensure transparency and trust in hate speech detection pipelines.
